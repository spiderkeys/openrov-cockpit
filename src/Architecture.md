The cockpit consist of javascript that runs on both the browser as well as on a node.js process on the embedded linux computer on the ROV.
The core of the cockpit software is a single page application that has a standard set of containers in the browser (div tags and the such) that plugins know about so that they can inject there own UI elements and behaviors.
The contract between the node.js process and the browser are a series of socket.io connections that send "events" or messages both directions.  Both the browser and the node.js process have handlers and emmitters that respond to and send the messages between them.  The plugins are aware of these messages and have the ability to plugin to the message traffic to both listen to and inject their own messages.  The plugin can extend both the browser code as well as the node.js code.
